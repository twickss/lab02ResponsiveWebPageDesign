       <p>
        Great white sharks do not hunt in packs and are solitary hunters. The adults usually eat seals, sea lions, and large fish, 
        while the younger sharks eat smaller fish or crustaceans. Thanks to their slow metabolism, they can also go long periods without eating.
        </p>

        <h3>Subsection 1 - Hunting Tactics</h3>
        <p>
        Usually, they attack from a sudden vertical position from the depths of the water, relying on the element of surprise. 
        They may also swim rapidly at the surface to catch their prey, such as seals or sea lions.
        </p>

        <h3>Subsection 2 - Migration</h3>
        <p>
        Most of their migration patterns are random and unpredictable, with great whites traveling thousands of miles across the major oceans. 
        However, some researchers have noticed patterns in the sharks they study. For example, some marine biologists have tracked these 
        creatures swimming from Hawaii to California.
